# Practical 1

**At the time of writing JupyterLab is not working on the Desktop PCs. Please use one of the laptops or your own device.**

## About Jupyter

Jupyter is an application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser: files known as Jupyter notebooks (extension .ipynb).

## Launching JupyterLab

* Open up Anaconda. 
* In the JupyterLab panel select "Launch".

JupyterLab will launch in a web-browser. It might take a little while the first time it launches.

You will be presented with the Jupter launcher page on the right. 

## Opening a Jupyter notebook

The practical sessions, including exercises, are contained inside a Jupyter notebook. In the course website menu for week 1, right click and **save the notebook into your H drive**. It would be a good time to think about organising your files sensibly, perhaps create a Python or MAS1801 folder there.

In JupyterLab, navigate to the directory where you saved the file and double click it.

You may get a prompt asking you which *kernel* you would like to use (effectiely which language it should use to interpret the file). Choose Python 3.

## Using the Jupyter notebooks


Press shift-enter to run a cell. Or go to the run item in the menu to see more options, such as "Run all cells".

Use the + button to add a new cell wherever you like. You can use this to make extra notes, try things out etc.

When you get to an exercise, you can insert your solution in the provided code block.



## Opening a new Jupyter notebook

In the Launcher tab, under "Notebook" click on "Python 3". This will open up a blank notebook in which you can add your own content. Don't forget to save it somewhere sensible with a descriptive filename (not untitled.ipynb)!


## Using the Python3 Console

You might also like to simply use a Python Console to test code in.

Click on the Launcher tab in JupyterLab.

Under Console, click on Python 3. You will see some information displayed in the screen at the top and an input box where your cursor should be flashing.

Type in

```{.python data-gutter-symbol=">>>" data-code-dir="input"}
2+2
```

and press shift-Enter. This will send the command to the console.

    "Using these handouts\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In the practical sessions you will be working through one of these\n",
    "(virtual) handouts. If you want a printable version then hit the link\n",
    "“Download chapter as PDF”.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might need some scrap paper for some of the exercises. If you don’t\n",
    "have any then let me know.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should try out commands: I suggest copying the bits of code like\n",
    "this one\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "x = 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "into the Spyder and exploring them by changing variables and so on. When\n",
    "you see text formatted like this: `x`, I am referring to variables or\n",
    "other bits of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest you set up your windows like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\*\\* pic/vid \\*\\*\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst you are working through, I’ll wander round, as will my fab\n",
    "postgraduate helpers; just stick your hand up or give me a shout if\n",
    "you’d like any assistance. Don’t be afraid to ask questions, no matter\n",
    "how silly they might seem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My handouts have some items in them along the way. They go like this…\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interlude\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interlude, which contains something either totally off-topic,\n",
    "usually not assessed and just there for a bit of fun. Yes, programming\n",
    "can be fun! :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an exercise. Sometimes there’ll be an answer, sometimes they are\n",
    "just to get you thinking. I’ll release solutions and comments for each\n",
    "of these next week. I suggest that you try them as you reach them in the\n",
    "notes and that you save your answers into a script file (which we’ll\n",
    "find out about later in this handout).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\\*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an exercise that you need to hand in this week (there may be\n",

    "\n",
    "### About Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit of blurb to go in here\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to be using the the integrated development environment\n",
    "(IDE) Spyder to run our Python code. Spyder is open source and\n",
    "cross-platform, so you can **insert link re installing on own machine**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python 2 and Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick explanation\n",
    "\n",

    "Python as a calculator\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to use Python is to enter a command in the *Console*\n",
    "and allow Python to execute it and return the result. I’m showing you\n",
    "the command and output here, but feel free to copy and paste or write\n",
    "commands in Python to follow along. The *\\>\\>\\>* represents the Python\n",
    "prompt, which varies with IDE. Copy and paste, or enter, the code after\n",
    "the prompt into Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "2+2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "0.6666666666666666\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can access the value of any previous output using\n",
    "`Out[n]`. This is a little bit like the `Ans` on your calculator (well,\n",
    "on my calculator at least).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Variable assignment -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable Assignment\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assign values to variables, in the Console again, we’re going to\n",
    "set a variable `x` equal to -3:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "x = -3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Python is pretty quiet - it doesn’t make a lot of fuss. You\n",
    "can see that `x` has definitely been set in the *Variable explorer*, but\n",
    "if you want to display its value in the Console:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "``` python\n",
    "y = x**2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look again at the *Variable explorer*. Here you can keep an eye\n",
    "on the type and value of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some rules to follow when naming and using variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Python is case sensitive, so the variable `x` is not the same as\n",
    "    `X`.\n",
    "-   variable names can contain numbers, but cannot start with a number.\n",
    "-   variable names cannot contain spaces (however you can use an\n",
    "    underscore if you like).\n",
    "-   when we do more extensive code, descriptive variable names will help\n",
    "    when you come back to look at your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arithmetic operators\n",
    "\n",

    "Using Functions\n",
    "---------------\n",

    "find out how to use more of these…\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like a mathematical function, a function on a computer takes some\n",

    "\n",
    "This imports the `math` module and will be imported quietly\n",
    "(successfully). Try running the same command with a different name and\n",
    "you will see what happens when a module cannot be found by Python, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import maths\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "gives the error *ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘maths’*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to our correct `math` module, the reference guide\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html contains a full list of the\n",
    "functions and definitions contained in the `math` module and we note\n",
    "that there is a function `cos`.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "y = math.cos(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the syntax to use the `cos` function from the `math` package. This\n",
    "is important, because there may be (are in fact any seond) other modules\n",
    "which also have a `cos` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `numpy` module\n",
    "\n",
    "The *numpy* module declares itself “the fundamental package for\n",
    "scientific computing with Python”. It is a key module that we will use a\n",
    "lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the module with\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import numpy\n",

    "And an awful lot more\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "numpy.sqrt(numpy.pi)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s pretty laborious writing out “numpy” every time you run a command,\n",
    "so Python has a shortcut. You can do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "np.cos(np.pi)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use some functions from the *numpy* module to do our first\n",
    "exercise…\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperbolic sine function $\\sinh(x)$ can be defined in terms of\n",
    "exponentials as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sinh(x)=\\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Use the function `exp` to calculate $\\sinh(\\pi)$ using the\n",
    "    expression on the right of the above equation.\n",
    "-   Verify that you get the same answer with the command `sinh(pi)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above documentation tells us that there is both a function\n",
    "`math.exp` as well as a mathematical constant `math.e`. Either could be\n",
    "used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Types\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "An understanding of different data types is important for any\n",
    "programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following on from some of the trigonometry in the previous section, have\n",
    "a go at this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "z = np.sin(np.pi/3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We all know that $\\sin(\\pi/3)=\\sqrt{3/2}$, but we don’t get a nicely\n",
    "answer like this (try it and you will get 0.8660254037844386). Python\n",
    "makes its computations in what is known as floating point arithmetic (by\n",
    "default); when it makes its calculation it thinks of pi as a decimal,\n",
    "hence the decimal output. There are symbolic mathematics packages for\n",
    "Python but we won’t use those in this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the variable explorer you will find that the type of the variable `z`\n",
    "is a *float*. You might also have some integers with type *int* still in\n",
    "your workspace. Let’s find out more about these and other data types…\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `type` can tell us the data type of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "Python stores integers as a separate data type which it calls *int*.\n",
    "Why? Well there’s no point in storing a load of decimal places if you\n",
    "have whole numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "type(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other data types can be converted to integers using the function `int`.\n",
    "Here `x` is a decimal number.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "x = 2.0\n",
    "int(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the intended use is not rounding or formatting numbers. We’ll\n",
    "come back to that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floating point numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section we dealt with some decimal numbers… strictly\n",
    "speaking these were really what are called floating-point numbers, and\n",
    "Python refers to them as a *float*.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "type(math.pi)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "float\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `float` will take a different data type and turn it into a\n",
    "float. Here `x` is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "x = 2\n",
    "float(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "2.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complex numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "You may or not have already come across complex numbers. Well, this is\n",
    "as good a place as any to mention them, even if we don’t really use them\n",
    "in this bit of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a complex number as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "z = 2+3j\n",
    "type(z)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "complex\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and easily query its real and imaginary parts\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "A boolean is an object that is either true or false and is referred to\n",
    "as type *bool* in Python. There are only two values for this data type:\n",
    "`True` and `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "type(True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "bool\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that computers store boolean values as 0s (for false) and 1s (for\n",
    "true), so the result of this sort of conversion is not surprising:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "int(True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",

    "element with index 3 above is the fourth in the list! There are long and\n",
    "boring reasons why, which I won’t waste pixels with, but importantly\n",
    "this is different in other languages (including R, which you will learn\n",
    "next semester), so take care!\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be used with other data types too. For example strings:\n",

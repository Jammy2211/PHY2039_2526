(but keep it clean, your name appears!)

## Welcome!

Plan for today:

* Announcements and admin!
* Intro from me
* Work with our demonstrating team
* Ask questions
* Get used to the brave new world!

## Announcement ðŸ˜Ž


New ways to access Anaconda/Spyder.

* Install on your own device

## Admin

How does this [module](https://ncl.instructure.com/courses/32310){target="_blank"} work then?

## Before we get stuck in...

I have seen many students over the years and the many ways they approach computing in their degree programme. Since I can't be there to know you better. Let's look at some of the typical characters that I see...

. . .

You can tell me which one you are shortly!

. . .

And which one your demonstrator is!

. . .

### Gee-100 

<img src="/static/images/week1/mathsfan.png" style="float: right; width: 350px;margin-left: 30px">


Note *Gee-100* may not be doing G100.

Solid maths skills.

They're not sure why they're learning computing in their maths degree.

Might be able to bring them over to the dark side.

--- 

### Comp-ready

<img src="/static/images/week1/computerfan.png" style="float: right; width: 350px; margin-left: 30px">


Comp-ready has done computing before. 

Asks lots of questions.

Needs extra challenges!

Might know more than me - could get embarassing.


--- 

### Piggy-back

<img src="/static/images/week1/piggyback.png" style="float: right; width: 350px; margin-left: 30px">


Piggy-back is too busy for computing

Waits for computing ideas from their good friend *comp-ready*

Might find the jump to stage 2 computing tricky, it's a long way down...

--- 

### Google-a-lot

<img src="/static/images/week1/google.png" style="float: right; width: 350px; margin-left: 30px">


Google-a-lot has perfected the art of searching for answers on the internet.

Lets the computer do the hard work whilst relaxing with a margarita.

--- 

### Bee

<img src="/static/images/week1/angry.png" style="float: right; width: 350px; margin-left: 30px">


Bee gets angry at their computer. 

It's almost certainly the computer's fault.

Maintain social distance.

---

Of course I care for all of my students equally!

<img src="/static/images/week1/google.png" style="float: left; width: 170px; margin: 30px 5px">
<img src="/static/images/week1/angry.png" style="float: left; width: 170px; margin: 30px 5px">


. . .

This is a good point to meet your demonstrator for today. We're off into breakout rooms!


---

## Week 1 - Refreshing

Many of you are new to Python. So we'll spend lots of time refreshing the basics.

## Week 1 & 2 - Curve fittingÂ 

The rest of this week and next will be dedicated to curve fitting.

---

## Breaking out again

In the breakout rooms, you'll work with a demonstrator to do some plotting and explore ideas around curve fitting.

---

## Curve fitting thoughts

<img src="/static/images/week1/cubicornot.png" style="float: right; width: 450px; margin-left: 40px; border: none; box-shadow: none;">


We need to figure out this week and next:

. . .

* how to find out if our fit is any good

. . .

* how to find the **best** fit possible

. . .

* how to fit polynomials of higher degree

. . .

* how to fit other functions 

---

## Your choice

I will re-open the breakout rooms in a moment. Use this as a chance to:

. . .

* ask for help from your demonstrator

. . .

* work quietly on handout 1

. . .

* have a go at Anaconda on WVD (I'll post a link)

. . .

I'll stay in the main room; if you want to ask anything admin-related then head back out from your breakout room and say hi.

## Coming up...

* Test Yourself test, tomorrow evening
* Office hour Thursday 1-2pm
* Week 2 content on Monday
* Next week's session is Thursday 12-1pm

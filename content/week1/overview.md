# Week 1 Overview


## Week 1 timetable

* Practical 1: Friday 15th November 9-11am in the Herchel Computer Cluster
* Office hours: Thursday 3-4pm in Herschel 4.05c (this week only; I will have slightly different office hours next week).


## Week 1 content

This week's lecture and handout will cover the following.

Accessing Python:

* An introduction to the Python programming language.
* An introduction to the Spyder, which we will use to write Python code.
* How to open Spyder in a University cluster, or your own device.

Python basics:

* Using Python as a calculator to do basic arithmetic.
* Assigning values to variables.
* Using built-in functions.
* Using modules to extend Python's functionality.
* Data types
* Working with lists and arrays.
* Writing and saving Python scripts.


## Optional reading: *Hello, world!*

Over the course of your studies, you will learn at least two programming languages, R and Python (technically Python 3), and possibly more. It's traditional that one of the first things to do when studying a new language is to find out how to write a program which displays the message "Hello World". Here's a [website that describes how to do so in nearly 600 programming languages](http://helloworldcollection.de/){target="_blank"}! It's interesting to get context of how many different languages there are! Take a look and see how Python compares to other languages.

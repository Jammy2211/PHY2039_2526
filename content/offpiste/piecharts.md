![Pie chart with assessment 2 highlighted](images/piecharts/pie_assessment2.png){style="float: right; width: 300px;"}


On the assessment page, I added some pie charts to give a visual reminder of the relative weightings of our assessments. We don't look at pie charts in this course, so thought a good way\* to kick off the *off piste* section would be to show you how I made these.

*\* In fact, I was on a train home from a conference with countless other things that I really should have been doing, but were less fun.*

## A basic pie chart

Creating pie charts with Matplotlib isn't too difficult. Here's a basic pie chart:


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

weightings = [70,20,10] 
titles = ["Exam","Assessment 2","Assessment 1"]

plt.pie(weightings, labels = titles, startangle = 90)
```

The `startangle` option isn't reaquired, but is setting the start angle of the first wedge to the top. Here's the output:

![A basic pie chart](images/piecharts/piechart.png){style="max-width: 450px;"}

## Customised pie charts for each assessment

My train journey was going pretty slowly, so I decided that an individual plot per assessment would be pretty neat, with features that exaggerate the highlighted "wedge". 

![Pie chart with assessment 2 highlighted](images/piecharts/pie_assessment2.png){style="float: left; width: 360px;"}
![Pie chart with assessment 1 highlighted](images/piecharts/pie_assessment1.png){style="float: left; width: 340px;"}
![Pie chart with the exam highlighted](images/piecharts/pie_exam.png){style="float: left; width: 360px;"}

<br style="clear:both;">

Here are the new ingredients of the code that follows:

* A loop over the number of assessments (so there's a plot for each one): `for n in range(len(weightings)):` This could have been as simple as `for n in range(3):` but I wanted it to be adaptable in case the number of assessments change. Remember that everything indented is then in the for loop.

* A default colour for each wedge, set with the `colors =` option in the pie chart function. I created a list of different greys, `colours = ["lightgrey","darkgrey","silver"]` (so that when I set the highlighted wedge to a bright colour it would pop out!). I used the [list of colours here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html){target="_blank"}

* I've used the `explode=` option in the pie chart function to make one of the wedges jump out. This is set through a list I called `standout`, which I initially set to all zeros.  I then set the nth item to 0.2 (which was most aesthetically pleasing to me) in the line `standout[n] = 0.2`.

* The pie chart properties can be manipulated by writing `wedges, labels = plt.pie(...)` - the label and wedge corresponding to the nth item are then manipulated on the bottom lines.

* This line probably looks weirdest in the code: `labels[n].set_text("{}\n{:>10}%".format(titles[n],weightings[n]))`. It is combining the label text and weighting and formatting it with a bit of padding (the part with `"{}\n{:>10}%"`), again just for some aesthetic pleasure. You might find this easier to follow by trying out a more straightforward string format example, e.g. `"Here is a {}".format("string")`

Here goes...

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Set title, weighting and default colours
weightings = [70,20,10] 
titles = ["Exam","Assessment 2","Assessment 1"]
colours = ["lightgrey","darkgrey","silver"]

# Loop over assessments to create individual plots
for n in range(len(weightings)):

    # Make a plot for this assessment
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
    plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 20
    
    # Explode the segment for this assessment only
    standout = np.zeros(len(weightings))
    standout[n] = 0.2
    
    # Create the pie chart and objects wedges and labels which can be manipulated
    wedges, labels = plt.pie(weightings, labels = titles, 
                explode = standout, startangle = 90,
                colors = colours, shadow = True)
    
    # Customise for this assessment
    wedges[n].set_color("firebrick")
    labels[n].set_color("firebrick")
    labels[n].set_text("{}\n{:>10}%".format(titles[n],weightings[n]))
```

Note that <span style="background: #B12322; color: white; padding: 2px;">firebrick</span> is my current favourite Matplotlib colour. You can find a [full list of colours here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html){target="_blank"}.

### Not an exercise 

**a)** A challenge for you (note the warning at the start again!). See if you can modify the code to make alternative donut plots like the below... You'll need a search engine!

![Donut with the exam highlighted](images/piecharts/donut_exam.png){style="width: 300px;"}

(I'm not posting a solution, but you can come and see me about it if you like!)


**b)** And finally, can't resist this one from the internet that tickles me. Have a go at recreating this (you'll need `plt.legend(...)` for the legend.

![A pie chart that looks like a pyramid](images/piecharts/pyramid.png){style="width: 500px;"}

If you've seen (and even better can recreate) anything cool pie/donut related let me know!

Enjoy!

### Addendum - More pie charts

#### Pacman

Thank you for the following student submission!

```python
"""
PAC-MAN PIE CHART
"""
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# NUMBERS
weightings = [100,30]

# MAKING PIE CHART
ax = plt.subplot(111)
ax.pie(weightings, startangle = 40, colors = ["yellow", "white"], 
    wedgeprops = {"edgecolor" : "black",'linewidth': 2,'antialiased':True})

# ADDING LABELS / LEGEND
plt.title("Proportion of chart which resembles Pac-man", loc = "center")
plt.legend(["Resembles Pac-man", "Does not resemble Pac-man"], loc = "center", bbox_to_anchor=(0.5,0))

# PLOT SIZE
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (10, 8)
plt.rc('font', size = 20)
```

![Pacman](images/piecharts/pacman1.png){style="width: 350px;"}


Since it's my job to give feedback, I added the following (by trial and error!)

```python
plt.plot(0.2,0.55,'o',markersize=30,color='black')
```

#### Donut

Whilst I was putting scatter plots in handout 2, I had this brainwave...

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def pol2cart(rho, phi):
    """
    Converts polar to cartesian
    """
    x = rho * np.cos(phi)
    y = rho * np.sin(phi)
    return(x, y)

# Set figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 20

# Create the donut
wedges, labels = plt.pie([1], colors = ["mediumvioletred"], 
                         wedgeprops=dict(width=0.6), shadow=True)

# Add some sprinkles - coordinates
no_sprinkles = 400
rho = 0.4+0.6*np.random.rand(no_sprinkles)
phi = 2*np.pi*np.random.rand(no_sprinkles)
x,y = pol2cart(rho,phi)

# Random colours and sizes
colours = np.random.choice(["pink", "snow", "chocolate", "orange"], no_sprinkles)
sizes = np.random.randint(1, 100, no_sprinkles)

# Let's sprinkle
plt.scatter(x, y, c=colours, s=sizes, marker='o')
```

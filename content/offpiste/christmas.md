<h1><span style="font-size: 25px;">MAS2806/PHY2039 Off-Piste 8:</span><br/>Christmas Trees</h1>

In this edition of MAS2806/PHY2039 off-piste, I have one goal, and that is to make a shiny Christmas Tree. ðŸŽ„

To get there, I'm going to introduce you to the Barnsley Fern: arguably the coolest thing that you can plot in 30 lines of Python code!

##  Barnsley Fern

The Barnsley Fern (named after the mathematician Michael Barnsley, rather than the South Yorkshire Town) is a fractal pattern generated through what's known as an [iterated function system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system){target="_blank"}.

The way it works is not difficult to code up: we generate a series of $(x,y)$ coordinates through a number of different transformations to go from $(x_n,y_n)$ to $(x_{n+1},y_{n+1})$, weighted by probability.

The Barnsley fern is specifically generated through the following:

* This generates points on the leaf stem (used with probability 0.01)
  $${\displaystyle f_{1}(x,y)={\begin{pmatrix}\ 0.00&\ 0.00\ \\0.00&\ 0.16\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\ x\\y\end{pmatrix}}}$$

* This generates successsively smaller ferns (used with probability 0.85)
  $${\displaystyle f_{2}(x,y)={\begin{pmatrix}\ 0.85&\ 0.04\ \\-0.04&\ 0.85\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\ x\\y\end{pmatrix}}+{\begin{pmatrix}\ 0.00\\1.60\end{pmatrix}}}$$

* This generates leaves on the left (probability 0.07)
  $${\displaystyle f_{3}(x,y)={\begin{pmatrix}\ 0.20&\ -0.26\ \\0.23&\ 0.22\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\ x\\y\end{pmatrix}}+{\begin{pmatrix}\ 0.00\\1.60\end{pmatrix}}}$$

* This generates leaves on the right (probability 0.07)
  $${\displaystyle f_{4}(x,y)={\begin{pmatrix}\ -0.15&\ 0.28\ \\0.26&\ 0.24\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\ x\\y\end{pmatrix}}+{\begin{pmatrix}\ 0.00\\0.44\end{pmatrix}}}$$

There are some lovely short videos which illustrate each of the transformations on [this page, around half way down](https://www.algorithm-archive.org/contents/barnsley/barnsley.html){target="_blank"}.

Coding this is relatively straightforward: we create some arrays (`x` and `y`), use a for loop and choose how to transform based on a random value (`r`) generated at each iteration. Here's some code.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import numpy as np 

# Nice big plot 
plt.figure(figsize=(20,30)) 
  
# initialize x and y
nmax = 1000000
x = np.zeros(nmax) 
y = np.zeros(nmax) 

for n in range(nmax-1): 

    # generates a random number in [0,1] 
    r = np.random.rand()

    # Get the next value based on r
    if r <= 0.01: 
        x[n+1] = 0 
        y[n+1] = 0.16*y[n] 
    elif r > 0.01 and r <= 0.86: 
        x[n+1] = 0.85*x[n] + 0.04*y[n]
        y[n+1] = -0.04*x[n] + 0.85*y[n] + 1.6 
    elif r > 0.86 and r <= 0.93: 
        x[n+1] = 0.2*x[n] - 0.26*y[n] 
        y[n+1] = 0.23*x[n] + 0.22*y[n] + 1.6
    else:
        x[n+1] = -0.15*x[n] + 0.28*y[n] 
        y[n+1] = 0.26*x[n] + 0.24*y[n] + 0.44 

plt.plot(x, y, 'o', color='#4d9e3a', markersize = 0.5) 
plt.axis('off') 
```

How amazing is this!

If you'd like a higher-res image, increase `nmax` and reduce the `markersize` in `plt.plot`.

### Not an exercise 

Have a go at just changing some of the parameters, probabilities etc to see how it changes the look. That's exactly what I did in the next section.

## Christmas Tree!

So to make the Christmas tree below, I did the following:

* Messed around with the parameters in the Barnsley Fern til I had something that looked Christmas-tree-like. Even added in a power e.g. $x^{4/5}$ to add a bit of curve.
* Added baubles using some colours and coordinates. At first I tried to be clever about generating positions for these, but it looked weird, so I ended up just hand picking them more randomly.
* The baubles have a "thread" to hang from the tree using an additional `|` marker and a second marker overlaying the bauble adds a bit of shadow!
* Added a star on top!

Enjoy...

plt.figure(figsize=(20,30)) 
  
# initialize x and y
nmax = 1000000
x = np.zeros(nmax) 
y = np.zeros(nmax) 

for n in range(nmax-1): 

    # generates a random number in [0,1] 
    r = np.random.rand()

    # Get the next value based on r
    if r <= 0.05: 
        x[n+1] = 0 
        y[n+1] = 0.2*y[n] 
    elif r > 0.05 and r <= 0.87: 
        x[n+1] = 0.7*x[n] + 0.005*y[n]
        y[n+1] = -0.02*x[n] + 0.83*y[n] + 0.9
    elif r > 0.87 and r <= 0.93: 
        x[n+1] = 0.3*x[n] - 0.28*y[n]**(4/5) 
        y[n+1] = 0.3*x[n] + 0.28*y[n] + 0.2
    else:
        x[n+1] = -0.3*x[n] + 0.28*y[n]**(4/5) 
        y[n+1] = 0.3*x[n] + 0.28*y[n] + 0.2

plt.plot(x, y, 'o', color='#4d9e3a', markersize = 0.5) 
plt.axis('off') 

# Add some baubles
baubles = [[-1.025,1.455],[1.025,1.455],[0.73,2.05],
           [-0.69,2.05], [-0.31,3],[0.5,1.5],
           [-0.3,1.23],[0.3,0.31],[0.2,1.85],
           [0.1,2.8],[-0.6,0.68],[-0.07,3.9],
           [0.21,3.59],[-0.25,2.0],[0.06,0.9],
           [0.6,0.7],[-0.07,2.3],[0.3,2.75]]

# Various colours for baubles
colors = ["silver","goldenrod","indianred","firebrick","lightsteelblue"]

for b in baubles:
    # Get a colour
    c = np.random.choice(colors)
    # Add bauble thread
    plt.plot(b[0],b[1]+0.1,'|',color=c,markersize=80)
    # Add bauble
    plt.plot(b[0],b[1],'o',color=c,markersize=40)
    # Add bauble shadow
    plt.plot(b[0]+0.01,b[1]-0.01,'o',color='white',markersize=30,alpha=0.2)

# Star on the top!
plt.plot(0.08,5.1,'*',color='goldenrod',markersize=150)
plt.plot(0.08,5.1,'*',color='white',markersize=100,alpha=0.3)
```

Finally, just the icing on the cake, a little bit of animation to make the baubles more like twinkling lights...

```python
bauble_colours = np.random.choice(colors,len(baubles))


def animate(i):
    n = 0
    for b in baubles:
        # Re-draw bauble
        plt.plot(b[0],b[1],'o',color=bauble_colours[n],markersize=40)
        # Add bauble shadow randomly
        if np.random.choice([0,1]):
            plt.plot(b[0],b[1],'o',color='white',markersize=40,alpha=0.4)
        n += 1


anim = FuncAnimation(fig,func=animate,frames=20)
anim.save("animation.gif", writer=PillowWriter(fps=2))
```

I've even grabbed some [royalty free music](https://pixabay.com/music/search/genre/christmas/){target="_blank"} to play whilst you enjoy looking at this one!

Thanks everyone, hope you have happy holidays and good luck with the exam in January!

### Not an exercise: decorate my door! 

Send me your Python-made Christmas tree (and the code to make it). Or if you're just celebrating winter/holidays, a snow flake / snowman / whatever and I'll put you on my door to brighten up the 3rd floor of Herschel.

You could check out [SierpiÅ„ski triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle){target="_blank"}, or [Koch Snowflakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake){target="_blank"}, try your own parameters with the Barnsley Fern or add some baubles to the Test Yourself in week 6...

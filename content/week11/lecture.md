## Advice: before the exam

Make sure you know the following **before** the exam:

* The location of the cluster you have been scheduled in. The exam will be split over a number of clusters, and you are unlikely to be scheduled in the Herschel cluster.
* How to log in to the cluster PCs and access Spyder. In particular, make sure you know your IT account password.
* Have transferred any files you may wish to consult during the exam to your University OneDrive.

## Advice: during the exam

The exam is made up of 4 questions, each of roughly equal length. You have two hours (plus any additional time as per an SSP) to complete the exam.

This suggests approximately 30 minutes per question, including checking your work.

Other suggestions:

* Have a pen and paper with you.

* Remember that you can complete the questions in any order, and move between questions e.g. complete Q1)a), then Q2)a)... Just make sure you have submitted all answers before changing questions

* Don't consider the exam complete until you have checked your work.

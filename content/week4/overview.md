# Week 3 Overview


## Week 3 timetable

* Lecture 3: Tuesday 26th November 3-4pm in Herschel LT1
* Practical 3: Friday 29th November 9-11am in the Herchel Computer Cluster
* Office hours: 1-2pm on both Thursday and Friday


## Week 3 content

This week's lecture and handout will cover the following, both of which are essential building blocks of computer code:

Control flow: we'll be looking at constructs that control if and when bits of code are run. If you want to take a look, they are mostly covered in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html){target="_blank"}.

And functions: we'll find out how to write our own functions, and in week 4 how we will put these together to create our own modules. 


## Optional reading: some inspiration

[Here's a link to a "chatbot" that somebody has written in Python](https://apps.worldwritable.com/tutorials/chatbot/){target="_blank"}, quite an interesting application of some of the stuff we will be using this week. You can go ahead and change their code and re-run, which might give you a feel for this week's content.

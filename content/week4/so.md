## The Bisection Method

The bisection method homes-in on a root of a function f(x) using systematic trial and error:

* Identify lower and upper bounds $[x_l, x_h]$, such that $f(x_l)<0$ and $f(x_{h})>0$, The root $x_*$ is therefore in between: $x_l < x_* < x_h$.

* Evaluate the function at the midpoint of the bound (is it positive or negative?) to eliminate half of the range.

* Repeat until $x_h - x_l$ is sufficiently small.

In the breakout rooms we'll look at how we can make this more sophisticated with the tools we've looked at this week (functions, if statements and for loops)

##Â Round-up

Next week... two more methods for root finding...

* The Secant Method
* The Newton-Raphson Method

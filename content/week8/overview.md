## Week 4 content

This week are are going to be looking at two things:

* Packaging functions up to create our own **modules**. You can do [some pre-reading here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_modules.asp){target="_blank"}

* And we'll be creating our own **classes**.  Python is an object-orientated language (the focus is on objects rather than functions, which is why we see syntax `x.sort()` rather than `sort(x)`). A class is a blueprint for creating an object in Python, and as you will have seen in your project, we can create classes for objects such as cylinders, with *methods* which might be appropriate (such as to return the area or volume).

## Optional viewing: Teams

Here's a short video explaining the set up of a group in Teams, which I throughly recommend for your project:

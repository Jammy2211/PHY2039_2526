# Accessing Python

We are going to be using *Spyder* to write Python code, which is part of *Anaconda*, an open-source cross-platform distribution of Python.

The *Anaconda navigator* contains icons to launch *Spyder*.

## University Clusters

*Anaconda is installed in the Herschel cluster, Stephenson, Ridley, BSTC clusters and the library (TBC). If you regularly use a different cluster please let me know and I can ask for it to be installed.*

To open the "Anaconda navigator" on a cluster PC, click on the windows icon and start typing "anaconda".

Select the "Anaconda Navigator" icon.

This may take a few minutes to launch on first use and will ask if you would like to "help improve Anaconda". You can click "Ok, and don't show again". You can also decline updates and anything else that hassles you.

You should be presented with

From here launch *Spyder* by clicking on the launch button.

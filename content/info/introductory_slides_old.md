## Assessment

### Assignments (4 x 2.5%)

You will hand in solutions to exercises at the end of each handout. Unlike the problem solving sessions a little more time is given - to allow you to move at your own pace - hand in solutions by midnight on the Sunday each week.

### Group project (30%)

More info next week on the content. You will work in the same groups as the problem solving. 


## Why Study Computing?

### Computing as an Academic and life skill
 * The computing sections of MAS1801 and MAS1802 will prepare you for the computational needs of later modules
 * But it is also a very useful skill...
 * for your future studies...
 * for your career... 
 * and beyond... 
 * here are some examples...

Visualisations allow us to interpret, explore and understand mathematical models.

### Programming skills

 " Design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals, including controlling or simulating physical systems.

 Use sequence, selection, and repetition in programs; work with variables and various forms of input and output.

 Use logical reasoning to explain how some simple algorithms work and to find and correct errors in algorithms and programs.

 Select, use and combine a variety of software on a range of digital devices to design and create a range of programs, systems and content that accomplish specific goals, including collecting, analysing, evaluating and presenting data and information."

## Content

### Plotting

![](/static/images/intro/plotting.png){width="50%"}

Making plots won't be new to you, but we'll find out how to make the most 
of MATLAB's pretty impressive plotting capabilities.

### Data Types and Assignment

We routinely deal with different types of objects:


. . .

$1$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $2+3i$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $3.141592$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$

. . .

. . .

Name |   OJ
------|--------
Chris | Bits
Alice | Smooth

---

We will learn how to create and manipulate objects in MATLAB

---

### Concepts: Functions
We are quite comfortable with writing down a function such as:

$$f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2,$$

and using a function such as $\sin(x)$ on a calculator.

The concept of a computer function is not too different and we will learn how to create our own

---

### Concepts: Control flow
* A computer program is a list of instructions running one after another, creating a <span class="visible fragment highlight-red">flow</span>.

* We will learn about things such as 'for loops' and 'if statements'; constructions of code that change how a program flows.

* This seems a bit strange at first but they are already a part of our lives and essential in describing any sort of process in computer code.

	Go to Learning Lab for problem solving

## How to do well in this course
* Attend & stay caught up. Each week's practical will assume you've been to the lecture.
* Feel free to explore things that you're interested in.
* Be prepared to have a go at diagnosing problems with your code. Code almost never works first time and 
<span class="visible fragment highlight-red">debugging</span> is an important skill.
* Ask for help if you don't understand anything!

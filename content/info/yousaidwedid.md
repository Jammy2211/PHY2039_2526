# You Said, We Did

This page details how MAS1801 has developed in response to student feedback. 


## History of computing in MAS1801

MAS1801 was introduced in 2015/16 as part of a curriculum review which included embedding more computing in our degree programme. At stage 1, students studied MATLAB and R. I took the module on for the first time in 2018/19, and am running it for the second time. 

In 2018, academic staff made the decision to move from MATLAB to Python, and this change will be implemented as you move through your degree programme from 2019/20 for stage 1, 2020/21 for stage 2, and so on...

## 2018/19 You Said, We Did

Below is a selection of suggestions and feedback from students taking the module last year.


<table class="table table-striped">
<thead>
	<tr><th>You said </th><th>We did </th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td><i>"[Handout] questions could be more step by step in a similar way to examples"</i></td>
		<td>Agreed! I have tried to offer more hints and steps this year, and links to information about commands where it might be helpful</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td><i>"Working in the same groups as the problem solving part of the modules meant that the people who did the work in that part were expected to do the same in the computing."</i></td>
		<td>I am going to refresh the groups for the computing part this year.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><i>"Computing is taught in a way that you can go at your own pace, so you never feel pressured."</i></td>
		<td>Good to hear, but not sure everyone felt that way - there's a lot to go through in a short time!</td>
	</tr>	

	<tr>
		<td><i>"I didn't find the notes useful for the actual exercises."</i></td>
		<td>Noted, but I suspect this was a student who tried the exercises without working through the notes properly!</td>
	</tr>	

	<tr>
		<td><i>"Learning Matlab and problem solving was an extraordinary experience... it was the most exciting module in the first semester."</i></td>
		<td>No pressure on my part...</td>
	</tr>	
	 
	<tr>
		<td><i>"Chris is very friendly and approachable"</i></td>
		<td>I am, I think, and our postgraduate asssitants too, so please don't be afraid to ask questions, even if they seem silly!</td>
	</tr>

## I need your help

Feedback from students is a very important part to the development of this (and any) module. I like this module a lot, so intend to keep tight hold of it for a very long time! I would be delighted to hear your thoughts on what you like and don't, to continue its development, either in the Evasys questionnaire or through more informal channels. 

Thank you!

## Week 2 content

This week's lecture and handout will cover the following.

Plotting with Python:

* We are going to use the the *matplotlib* module. Head to the [matplotlib website](https://matplotlib.org/){target="_blank"} for a preview of what it can do, and the sort of code we will be writing.

Random numbers:

* We are also going to be looking at generating and using random numbers, which we'll do using numpy. Here's some [numpy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/routines.random.html){target="_blank"}  if you are interested (we'll mainly be doing the stuff under "simple random data").


## Optional reading: some inspiration

I had one of these sections last week, so have decided it's now a thing. My optional reading this week is really optional drooling... at some mouthwatering plots created my matplotlib. Check out the [matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html){target="_blank"}, where you can browse through for inspiration. All source code is provided too, and pretty much everything should work by copying and pasting in to Spyder. 

This is my favourite ([link to the source code to create this plot](https://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/dolphin.html){target="_blank"}). Enjoy!

## Breakout rooms

Today we'll be in much smaller breakout rooms. Say a quick hello!

. . .

If you need help, click on *Ask for Help*. Note it may take us a few minutes to get to you.

. . .

Once in the breakout rooms you can share screen and the chat is for your room only. Try to work together.

## This week

A very quick recap on `polyfit` and `polyval`.


---

## Problem for today


A scientist measures the weight of an unstable isotope over a number of days and records the results.


Day       |   1  |  2   |  3   |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10
----------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
Weight(g) | 24.3 | 18.1 | 11.7 | 7.3 | 4.9 | 2.9 | 2.6 | 1.5 | 1.0 | 0.5


. . .


(a) Set up some variables and make a plot of the data. Investigate the following Matplotlib functions. Which one gives a straight line?

   * `plt.plot()`
   * `plt.semilogx()`
   * `plt.semilogy()`
   * `plt.loglog()`

Any thoughts on what sort of function to fit to the data?

---

We're going to fit an exponential function of the form $y=a\exp(bx)$.


(b) Transform the equation into a linear polynomial by making a suitable change of variables in order to use `polyfit`, to find $a$ and $b$.

. . .

(c) Illustrate the fit with some plots.

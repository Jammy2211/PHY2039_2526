## This week

We look at a number of considerations around accuracy and stability of numerical methods, primarily focussing on the Euler Method.

---

### Ill-conditioned ODEs

The directional fields in the last section allow us to visualise another issue with the Euler Method. Consider the problem

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{y-5t}{1+t}, \quad y(0) = 3 $$

The directional fields look like this

The exact solution is added (it is $y(t) = 3 + 8t - 5(1 + t)\log(1 + t)$ - you can take my word for it). 

The issue with the Euler Method here is that a small change in the first step results in the solution being on an entirely different trajectory. This sort of problem is known as *ill-conditioned*, and in particular this is an issue where, for our ODE

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} =f(t,y) $$

the partial derivative

$$\frac{\partial f(t,y)}{\partial y} > 0 $$

Ill-conditioned problems (as opposed to *well-conditioned*) are particularly unforgiving on the Euler Method and are good candidates for a higher-order method such as Runge-Kutta.

##Â Summary

This is the last new content for the module. Later in the week I'll publish a mock test to help you prepare for the January assessment.

# Easter Project Day 1

## Morning - Introduction, induction and focus group

The aim of the morning will be to focus our minds on what we are trying to get out of the project.

We'll start off with an introduction to the purpose of this mini-project, and a short induction (required for all students working for the School).

I would like to find out more about what students think of the current computing teaching, so that we can pick out the best parts! We'll discuss the format of lectures, practicals, course material and also assessment.

### (Optional) Install on your own device

If you brought your own device then have a go at following the "Accessing Python" instructions to download Anaconda onto your own device.

* Did you have any problems installing? Is there any further information required?

## Afternoon - Practical 1

These are your tasks for this afternoon. I've added an extension task for those who might finish early, and if you don't finish at all then that's no problem, you can pick it up tomorrow.

### Work through "practical 1"

Try to put yourself in the mindset of someone starting out. You will likely find it easier than an incoming stage 1 student, as there is a lot of overlap with MATLAB and R. Equally some things are going to be counterintuitive, because you will have the mindset of how MATLAB and R work (and they are generally quite similar).

Please make some notes as you work through.

 * Is it easy to use? 
 * Are the static / animated screeshots useful? Should there be more?
 * Should the output to code always be displayed?
 * Are there words / jargon that are introduced which require more explanation?
 * Are the exercises easy / difficult? Do they require more help?
 * Is handout 1 too long? I'm thinking of moving some to week 2, it just doesn't sit so nicely in weeks.

### Do the hand-in exercise

You've done the same exercise before in MATLAB, but don't worry about that, go ahead and complete it (no need to upload though!).

### Work through the Jupyter notebook.

This is an alternative format for the practical notes. In theory these could be used instead of (or possibly aswell as) the more "traditional" practical material.

Read through the "Getting started with JupyterLab" page, which has instructions on opening and using JupyterLab. Then download and open "notebook 1". 

It's roughly the same content, but spend some time working through anyway to get a feel for the format. The change in format means that the way exercises are handed in would change.

### Create your own Jupyter notebook

Go back to the "Getting started with JupyterLab" page and take a look at the instructions to start your own notebook. This could be something that I demonstrate in the first lecture if this was the chosen teaching method, and it might be somewhere that you complete exericses, assignments or just use as a sandbox for trying out code.

Have a go at creating markdown and code blocks in your notebook, running your code etc.

### All finished?

Tomorrow morning we'll start by doing some practice exercises using a couple of different tools and I will make the next week of notes available. 

If you're all done then have a go at the following:

 * Come up with your own question(s) that you think would reinforce this first section of the notes. Keep it very focussed by picking one of the small sections or a function. You can just write this down on paper, or in the Teams page if you like. Write down the answer(s) too. Keep hold of it for the morning.

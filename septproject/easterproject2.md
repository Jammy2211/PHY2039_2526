# Easter Project Day 2

We'll start with a brief discussion about yesterday's material and today's activities. I'm out at a meeting from 10:30am; Alex (PGR) will be on hand if you have any queries, or you can mention me on Teams (type @ in the conversations page and start typing my name) and I may be able to respond. I might briefly call back at lunchtime. Please make as many notes as possible and we will start Friday morning with a further discussion about all of today's content.

## Exercises

There are now two additional links in the week 1 block:

### W3 Resource exercises

There are a lot of them, jsut pick a topic and a few questions, maybe spend half an hour on them. 

* Are they useful? Are any in particular useful after the first handout?

### Numbas questions

I have a very experimental extension to Numbas which handles computer code. Have a go at this short test.


## Practical 2

Practical 2 goes through plotting. Choose one or both of the "practical 2" format, or "notebook 2" Jupyter notebook.

Please make some notes as you go through: What is easy/difficult/needs more explanation?

Try all of the exercises.


## Practical 3

If you get through practical 2 then you can make a start on practical 3. 


## Friday

We'll meet in 4.05a at 9:30 on Friday (the library is in use) and will discuss today's content.

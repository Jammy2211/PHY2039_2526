# Python Day 1


## (Optional) Install on your own device

If you brought your own device then have a go at following the "Accessing Python" instructions to download Anaconda onto your own device.

* Did you have any problems installing? Is there any further information required?

## Practical 1

These are your tasks for this afternoon. I've added an extension task for those who might finish early, and if you don't finish at all then that's no problem, you can pick it up tomorrow.

### Work through "practical 1"

Try to put yourself in the mindset of someone starting out. You will likely find it easier than an incoming stage 1 student, as there is a lot of overlap with MATLAB and R. Equally some things are going to be counterintuitive, because you will have the mindset of how MATLAB and R work (and they are generally quite similar).

Please make some notes as you work through.

 * Is it easy to use? 
 * Are the static / animated screeshots useful? Should there be more?
 * Should the output to code always be displayed?
 * Are there words / jargon that are introduced which require more explanation?
 * Are the exercises easy / difficult? Do they require more help?
 * Is handout 1 too long? I'm thinking of moving some to week 2, it just doesn't sit so nicely in weeks.

### Do the hand-in exercise

You might have done the same exercise before in MATLAB, but don't worry about that, go ahead and complete it (no need to upload though!).

### Work through the Jupyter notebook.

This is an alternative format for the practical notes. In theory these could be used instead of (or possibly aswell as) the more "traditional" practical material.

Read through the "Getting started with JupyterLab" page, which has instructions on opening and using JupyterLab. Then download and open "notebook 1". 

It's roughly the same content, but spend some time working through anyway to get a feel for the format. The change in format means that the way exercises are handed in would change.

### W3 Resource exercises

There are a lot of them, jsut pick a topic and a few questions, maybe spend half an hour on them. 

* Are they useful? Are any in particular useful after the first handout?

### Numbas questions

I have a very experimental extension to Numbas which handles computer code. Have a go at this short test.


### Other questions

 * Are there other questions that you think would reinforce this first section of the notes?
